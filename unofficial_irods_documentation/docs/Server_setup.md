# Server Setup

iRODS is very sesntitive to hostmaes, so you must ensure that each server can resolve the names of other servers )_as they believe themselves to be called_.

This is particularly important when it comes to FQDN's etc, and if dealing with Spilt DNS and similar architectures where servers may resolve differently depending on the client/interface used for the resolution.
